# JSUI-Analog-Knob
A simple JSUI example creating an analog synth-style knob made.

This makes use of JSUI's ability to render and transform SVG and PNG files. In this case, the black knob body is an SVG file, while the silver center portion is a PNG (because JSUI doesn't handle angular shading).

The SVG and PNG graphics were made in Figma. You can see the Figma project [here:](https://www.figma.com/file/WyGINS15cVnWcbaubDGnpZ/Analog-Knobs?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=GlLDuPAYWd6A32hI-1).
